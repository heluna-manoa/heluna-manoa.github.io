# Welcome to Heluna Manoa

### The custom-built course rating website meant to help make schedule building easier.

Ever had to make a difficult choice between two courses (or professors) with no access to any helpful information? Maybe the professor is a graduate student, or maybe they have close to no teaching experience at Manoa, so RateMyProfessor doesn't display them.

This is where HelunaManoa can help. With our Warrior-sourced reviews and simple interface, you will be able to gain easy access to information that cannot be found on national websites.

## Landing Page (Unlogged)
<img src="doc/landing-unlogged.png" alt="landing">
The user is prompted to log in upon running the application. As of now, Heluna Manoa has a forest green theme that matches the colors of its affiliated university: the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The background picture is also somewhat of a placeholder and is subject to change in the following iterations of our project.

## Landing Page (With Search/Logged In)
<img src="doc/landing-logged.png" alt="landing logged">
Once the user logs in, they are taken to the actual landing page, which has a mock-up search bar where users can look for courses and professors.

## List/Search Courses Page
<img src="doc/list-courses.png" alt="list course">
This page shows a listing of all courses in the form of a table. The user is able to click on specific courses which lead to their own pages.

## Specific Course Page
<img src="doc/specific-course.png" alt="specific">
This page is a page whose content changes based on the specific course link that was clicked on. It displays the information for that course on its own page rather than in a table with other courses like the list courses page.

## Write Review Page
<img src="doc/write-review.png" alt="wr">
This page allows the user to write a review by entering the course title, the code of the course, the instructor's name, the course/instructor rating, and any comments about the course/instructor.

## Your Reviews Page
<img src="doc/your-reviews.png" alt="yr">
This page shows all of the current user's historical reviews. Each field will display the review along with buttons to edit or delete the review.

## Admin List Courses Page
<img src="doc/list-courses-admin.png" alt="adminlc">
In the case of there being a change in the details of a course listing, admins have the ability to go in and alter or delete course listings in an effort to update the list.

## Admin Add Course Page
<img src="doc/add-course-admin.png" alt="adminac">
This page allows admin to update course listings by adding a new course to the course collection.
