# Welcome to Heluna Manoa

### The custom-built course rating website meant to help make schedule building easier.

Ever had to make a difficult choice between two courses (or professors) with no access to any helpful information? Maybe the professor is a graduate student, or maybe they have close to no teaching experience at Manoa, so RateMyProfessor doesn't display them.

This is where HelunaManoa can help. With our Warrior-sourced reviews and simple interface, you will be able to gain easy access to information that cannot be found on national websites.
